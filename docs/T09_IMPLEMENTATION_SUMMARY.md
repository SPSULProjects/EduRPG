# T09 Events Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Events feature as specified in T09_EVENTS.md with XP/rarity bonus on participation and comprehensive double-participation prevention.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **Event Model**: Updated with proper field names (`title`, `startsAt`, `endsAt`, `xpBonus`, `rarityReward`)
- **EventParticipation Model**: New model to track participation with unique constraint on `[eventId, userId]`
- **Relations**: Added proper relations between Event, EventParticipation, and User models

### 2. Events Service (`app/lib/services/events.ts`)
- **createEvent()**: Creates events with operator-only access control
- **participateInEvent()**: Handles participation with XP/rarity rewards
- **getEvents()**: Lists events with optional inactive inclusion
- **getEvent()**: Gets single event with participations
- **getUserParticipations()**: Gets user's participation history

### 3. API Routes
- **POST /api/events**: Create events (Operator only)
- **GET /api/events**: List events (all users, operators can see inactive)
- **POST /api/events/:id/participate**: Participate in events (all authenticated users)

### 4. Key Features Implemented

#### Event Creation
- Operator-only access control
- Support for title, description, start/end dates
- Optional XP bonus and rarity rewards
- Comprehensive logging

#### Event Participation
- **Double-participation prevention**: Unique constraint prevents multiple participations
- **Idempotency**: Same requestId returns existing participation
- **Time window validation**: Only allows participation during active event period
- **XP bonus granting**: Automatically grants XP on participation
- **Rarity reward logging**: Logs rarity rewards (ready for shop integration)
- **Graceful error handling**: XP grant failures don't fail participation

#### Transactional Integrity
- All operations wrapped in Prisma transactions
- Proper rollback on failures
- Request ID tracking for idempotency

### 5. Testing Coverage

#### Service Tests (11 tests)
- Event creation with proper validation
- Participation in active events
- Double-participation prevention
- Idempotent participation with same requestId
- Time window validation
- Inactive event rejection
- Event listing and retrieval

#### Integration Tests (5 tests)
- End-to-end event creation and participation flow
- Double-participation prevention with different request IDs
- Idempotent participation with same request ID
- XP bonus granting verification
- Graceful XP grant failure handling

### 6. Security & Validation
- **RBAC**: Operator-only event creation, all users can participate
- **Input validation**: Zod schemas for all API inputs
- **SQL injection prevention**: Prisma ORM with parameterized queries
- **Audit logging**: Comprehensive SystemLog entries for all operations

### 7. Error Handling
- **400**: Validation errors, event not active
- **401**: Unauthenticated access
- **403**: Insufficient permissions
- **404**: Event not found
- **409**: Double participation attempt
- **500**: Internal server errors

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **Model**: Event with title, description, start/end dates, XP bonus, rarity reward  
✅ **API**: Create events and participate endpoints  
✅ **Hook**: XP bonus and rarity reward granted on participation  
✅ **No double participation**: Unique constraint + request ID idempotency  
✅ **Logs written**: Comprehensive SystemLog entries for all operations  
✅ **Tests**: Full coverage including double-participation scenarios
