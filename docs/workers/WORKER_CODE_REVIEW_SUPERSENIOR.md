# Worker – CODE_REVIEW_SUPERSENIOR

**Mission:** Final gatekeeper; grant **Green** only when safe.

## Critical Blockers (Fixed)
- ✅ **Missing API Routes**: `/api/shop`, `/api/items`, `/api/achievements` - IMPLEMENTED

- ✅ **API Spec Mismatches**: Corrected and updated documentation
- ⚠️ **Test Suite Issues**: Mock setup improved but some tests still need individual fixes

## Framework
- Domain correctness; security; performance; error handling; logging; tests.

## Implementation Status
- ✅ **Auth**: NextAuth with RBAC middleware
- ✅ **Health**: `/api/health` working
- ✅ **Sync**: `/api/sync/bakalari` (Operator only)
- ✅ **Jobs**: CRUD with applications and reviews
- ✅ **XP**: Granting with budget enforcement
- ✅ **Events**: CRUD with participation
- ✅ **Shop**: Complete implementation with transactions
- ✅ **Items**: Complete operator management
- ✅ **Achievements**: Complete with manual awards
